# Agent Framework (Simple) Sample

## Overview
This is a simple sample showing how to use the [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) as the orchestrator in an agent using the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK and Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
It covers:

- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
- **Notifications**: Services and models for managing user notifications
- **Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools for building advanced agent solutions
- **Hosting Patterns**: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

This sample uses the [Microsoft Agent 365 SDK for .NET](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-dotnet).

For comprehensive documentation and guidance on building agents with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK, including how to add tooling, observability, and notifications, visit the [Microsoft Agent 365 Developer Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/).

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or higher
- Microsoft Agent 365 SDK
- Azure/OpenAI API credentials
- OpenWeather Credentials (if using the OpenWeather Tool) 
    - see: https://openweathermap.org/price - You will need to create a free account to get an API key (its at the bottom of the page).

## Working with User Identity

On every incoming message, the A365 platform populates `Activity.From` with basic user information — always available with no API calls or token acquisition:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `Activity.From.Id` | Channel-specific user ID (e.g., `29:1AbcXyz...` in Teams) |
| `Activity.From.Name` | Display name as known to the channel |
| `Activity.From.AadObjectId` | Azure AD Object ID — use this to call Microsoft Graph |

The sample logs these fields at the start of every turn in `OnMessageAsync` ([MyAgent.cs](Agent/MyAgent.cs)) and injects `Activity.From.Name` into the LLM system instructions for personalized responses:

```csharp
var fromAccount = turnContext.Activity.From;
_logger?.LogInformation(
    "Turn received from user — DisplayName: '{Name}', UserId: '{Id}', AadObjectId: '{AadObjectId}'",
    fromAccount?.Name ?? "(unknown)",
    fromAccount?.Id ?? "(unknown)",
    fromAccount?.AadObjectId ?? "(none)");
```

## Handling Agent Install and Uninstall

When a user installs (hires) or uninstalls (removes) the agent, the A365 platform sends an `InstallationUpdate` activity — also referred to as the `agentInstanceCreated` event. The sample handles this in `OnInstallationUpdateAsync` ([MyAgent.cs](Agent/MyAgent.cs)):

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `add` | Agent was installed — send a welcome message |
| `remove` | Agent was uninstalled — send a farewell message |

```csharp
if (turnContext.Activity.Action == InstallationUpdateActionTypes.Add)
{
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(AgentHireMessage), cancellationToken);
}
else if (turnContext.Activity.Action == InstallationUpdateActionTypes.Remove)
{
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(AgentFarewellMessage), cancellationToken);
}
```

The handler is registered twice in the constructor — once for agentic (A365 production) requests and once for non-agentic (Agents Playground / WebChat) requests, enabling local testing without a full A365 deployment.

To test with Agents Playground, use **Mock an Activity → Install application** to send a simulated `installationUpdate` activity.

## Sending Multiple Messages in Teams

Agent365 agents can send multiple discrete messages in response to a single user prompt in Teams. This is achieved by calling `SendActivityAsync` multiple times within a single turn.

> **Important**: Streaming responses are not supported for agentic identities in Teams. The SDK detects agentic identity and buffers the stream into a single message. Use `SendActivityAsync` directly to send immediate, discrete messages to the user.

The sample demonstrates this in `OnMessageAsync` ([MyAgent.cs](Agent/MyAgent.cs)) by sending an immediate acknowledgment before the LLM response:

```csharp
// Message 1: immediate ack — reaches the user right away
await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text("Got it — working on it…"), cancellationToken);

// ... LLM processing ...

// Message 2: the LLM response (via StreamingResponse, buffered into one message for Teams agentic)
await turnContext.StreamingResponse.EndStreamAsync(cancellationToken);
```

Each `SendActivityAsync` call produces a separate Teams message. You can call it as many times as needed to send progress updates, partial results, or a final answer.

### Typing Indicators

For long-running operations, send a typing indicator to show a "..." progress animation in Teams:

```csharp
// Typing indicator loop — refreshes every ~4s for long-running operations.
using var typingCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken);
var typingTask = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    try
    {
        while (!typingCts.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(Activity.CreateTypingActivity(), typingCts.Token);
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4), typingCts.Token);
        }
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException) { /* expected on cancel */ }
}, typingCts.Token);

try { /* ... do work ... */ }
finally
{
    typingCts.Cancel();
    try { await typingTask; } catch (OperationCanceledException) { }
}
```

> **Note**: Typing indicators are only visible in 1:1 chats and small group chats — not in channels.

## Running the Agent
